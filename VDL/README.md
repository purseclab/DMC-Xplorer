JSON Output <br />
1)I had to make slight modifications from the JSON format mentioned in the earlier document.  <br />
2)The program outputs three seperate JSON files (va.json - VA setup details, devices.json - Smart Home Device details, vc.json - voice commands), I thought seperating them would be easier to process. <br />
3)Sample JSON files generated are also present along with their input code.<br />


1)Run the __main__.py program located in src\vapl. <br />
2)The program expects a input file of extension .vcl where the code is written. <br />
3)Sample code file is located at examples/new.vcl. <br />
4)The path of this file can be given as a parameter while running the program (examples/new.vcl -b). <br />
